# Membership

Our corporate members are a vital and integral part of Centaur.  Not only do
membership fees provide essential funding for the center's activities, but
members also have the opportunity to pose research challenges from the real
world and collaborate with the center on solutions.

[^1]: The desired commitment is 3 years to ensure continuity of funding and successful completion of research. Membership is renewed annually.
[^2]: See the section on visiting scholars in [Stanford's Research Policy Handbook](https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/non-faculty-research-appointments/visiting-scholars).

It is the intention of all Centaur researchers that any software developed will be released under a corporate-friendly open-source model, such as the 3-clause BSD license.

Presentations from faculty site visits and annual retreats, and all information, data and results arising from such interactions will be shared with all members and the public.

Employees at member companies get a discount on select professional and technical courses from the [Stanford Engineering Center for Global & Online Education](https://online.stanford.edu/professional-education).

# Additional Program Funding

Industrial Affiliates Programs may permit companies to provide additional
funding above the membership fee to support an area of on-going research within
the program. All research results arising from the use of the additional
funding will be shared with all program members and the general public.

Affiliate Program members may request the additional funding be used to support
a particular area of program research identified on the program website, or the
program research of a named faculty member, as long as the faculty is
identified on the program website as participating in Centaur.

In either instance, the director of Centaur will determine how the additional
funding will be used in the programâ€™s research.
