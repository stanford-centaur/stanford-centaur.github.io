- title: AI For Math Fund Awards Stanford University Centaur Lab $1,000,000
  excerpt: "The Stanford Center for Automated Reasoning (Centaur) has been
  awarded $1,000,000 as part of the AI for Math
  Fund, managed by Renaissance Philanthropy in partnership with founding donor
  XTX Markets. With this award, Centaur will have the opportunity to
  develop a two-pronged approach to formal theorem proving. One is a more
  transparent, search-based white-box algorithm for general machine-assisted
  theorem proving. The other one is an SMT-solver based tactic for Lean 4."
